Task:
```Provide a high-level architecture diagram of your application. The diagram should make clear if you are building a client-server application, or a stand alone application. It should include relevant external systems /if applicable/ your application depends on. 

For the diagram, add two or three paragraphs that explain what the meaning of the components represented in the diagram.

Provide one example of a static and a dynamic UML modeling aspect of your system.

Together with the diagram provide a section of written text that describes: - The context within which you created this diagram. This might for example be the use case that you were working on or modeling. - The motivation behind your choice of this particular aspect. This might be due to a challenging design decision or uncertainty about the relationship of domain concepts. - A brief reflection on the modeling choices you made and any knowledge that you gained from this model.

This section must not exceed 3 pages of A4, including the diagrams and their respective analysis.
```
